The arguments for isSameNumber are Integers, which are objects, unlike ints, which are primitative types. When == is applied on objects, Java compares the references of the objects, and returns true if they point at the same thing. This can lead to results that one might not expect, so instead, we have to use .equals. This method actually goes in and looks at the value of the objects, and compares if the values are the same (which is what is desired here).
